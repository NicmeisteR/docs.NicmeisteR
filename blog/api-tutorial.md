# Prerequisites:
---

## IDE
The first thing you will need is the foundation of every developer, an IDE (Integrated Development Environment). My recommendation is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) however you can use any IDE that you personally prefer.

## Git
Git is your best friend as a developer, what is Git? Git is a version control manager. It basically makes sure you don't lose anything you've done and it also allows you to store your code on Github and to clone other peoples projects from Github.

You can download Git here: https://git-scm.com/downloads

## NodeJs
Node JS is super important, this helps you install all sorts of packages to help with development, it also comes with a package manager called npm (node package manager) which you will use a lot.

You can download NodeJS here: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
